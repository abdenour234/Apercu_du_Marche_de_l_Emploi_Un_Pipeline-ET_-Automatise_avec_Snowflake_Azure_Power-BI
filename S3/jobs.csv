Senior Backend Engineer - MetaMask,Consensys,EMEA,"US, EU or Remote (excluding France, Australia and Canada)  Consensys is the leading blockchain and web3 software company founded by Joe Lubin, CEO of Consensys and Co-Founder of Ethereum. Since 2014, Consensys has been at the forefront of innovation, pioneering technological developments within the web3 ecosystem.  Through our product suite, including the MetaMask platform, Infura, Linea, Diligence, and our NFT toolkit Phosphor, we have become the trusted collaborator for users, creators, and developers on their path to build and belong in the world they want to see.  Whether building a dapp, an NFT collection, a portfolio, or a better future, the instinct to build is universal. Consensys inspires and champions the builder instinct in everyone by making web3 universally easy to use and develop on.  Our mission is to unlock the collaborative power of communities by making the decentralized web universally easy to access, use, and build on.  You‚Äôll get to work on the tools, infrastructure, and apps that scale these platforms to onboard one billion participants and 5 million developers. You‚Äôll be constantly exposed to new concepts, ideas, and frameworks from your peers, and as you work on different projects ‚Äî challenging you to stay at the top of your game. You‚Äôll join a network of builders that reaches the edge of our ecosystem. Consensys alumni have moved on to become tech entrepreneurs, CEOs, and team leads at tech companies.  About MetaMask  We‚Äôre building for a future where the internet and world economy empowers people through interactions based on consent, privacy, and free association, where both communities and individuals flourish. To accomplish that, we‚Äôre working hard to make web3 accessible for everyone.  MetaMask is both a crypto wallet and a gateway to the decentralized web. Our tools help people create communities, play video games, access financial services, make payments, invest in assets, protect against economic turmoil, and more. Our browser extension and mobile platforms meet the needs of millions of users and developers across the world.  The MetaMask Wallet API Platform Team  Empowering developers to deliver great decentralized user experiences is at the heart of MetaMask‚Äôs purpose. From the beginning, we have done so by providing the web with an API that allows any developer to turn their site or web-app into a decentralized app connected to the blockchain.  Currently the MetaMask Wallet API allows dApps to do things like: propose transactions to users, access the address of the users current account, use keys in MetaMask to help users encrypt and decrypt messages, propose to users that they sign specific messages, access the connected node/provider and call all methods on the Ethereum RPC API, and to propose that users add and switch to a specific network. We enhance and expand this list of capabilities and build tools to help other teams build new capabilities themselves.  To get a fuller picture of the current API, you can check out our documentation https://docs.metamask.io/wallet/concepts/wallet-api/  By improving and expanding this API, we can make entirely new types of decentralized user experiences possible. There is also much work to do to make this API accessible for the many new developers joining our space.  We are hiring engineers to join our Wallet API Platform team and help us build the platform on which the world‚Äôs most exciting dapps will be built.  What You‚Äôll Do  Build and maintain Wallet API infrastructure and tooling. Help to manage and govern a pipeline of proposed new APIs.Work with partners and standards bodies across the Web3 ecosystem to shape wallet API standards.

The senior software engineer role is a critical part of this team. They would be responsible for creating and managing the API that all MetaMask developers are using. As web3 evolves, the API needs to evolve with the larger ecosystem. This requires a team of highly dynamic and agile software engineers to serve MetaMask‚Äôs developer community.  Because of the complexity and nascency of web3, most of our API have a very long lifecycle after being made publicly available. The engineer who takes on this role will be the guardian of a high-quality API with a long lifecycle in a rapidly evolving ecosystem. This engineer must have a long-term mindset when planning and designing the API as well as introducing any new major change.

Senior DevOps Engineer,Smartcat,EMEA,"About SmartcatSmartcat is on a mission to become the wall-to-wall Language AI platform, addressing the diverse needs in multilingual content for various user personas within global enterprises. Smartcat is uniquely positioned within the $100+ billion multilingual content industry, which is currently served by tens of thousands of agencies. This results in a highly fragmented and inefficient supply chain, high costs, unacceptable turnaround times, and quality issues. Using highly qualified internal resources to translate or create multilingual content (insourcing) solves the quality problem for enterprises, but if done manually, it can't solve for scalability, high cost, and slow turnaround. Smartcat changes the ROI equation in favor of insourcing with its Language AI platform for enterprise end-users. It delivers high-quality, instantaneous AI translations or generates new content in any language by tapping into a customer-specific multilingual content library. The AI output is further refined through human editing by the client's internal reviewers or experts from the Smartcat's embedded global marketplace of linguists and content editors. This AI output continuously improves through the editing feedback loop, ensuring consistent and customer-tailored results. More than 1,000 global companies including ~20% of the Fortune 1,000 trust Smartcat to communicate their innovations and ideas all over the world.
